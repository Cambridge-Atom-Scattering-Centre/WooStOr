# WooStOr

WooStOr -  Wavepacket prOpogatiOn using SpliT OperatoR , is based on a Matlab code developed by Ocean Haghighi-Daly, with the main change being the convertion of the the core simulation to run in CUDA C, which had sped up the running time by a factor of about 6.

## Important!
- The program is still work in progress; in praticular, it has not been thoroughly tested.
- The manual is still a work in progress. It is not guranteed to be error free, as it has not yet passed internal refereeing and a complete set of benchmarking has yet to be done.
- The scripts folder may contain obselete scripts.
